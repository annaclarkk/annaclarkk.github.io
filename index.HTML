    <h1 class="noteTitle">Design Thinking - Rowe - Chapter 2 Notes</h1>
    <p><em>Rowe, P. G. (1987). Design Thinking. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.</em></p>

    <h2>Chapter 1 Notes</h2>
    <p>Chapter 1 is an overview of several designers' responses to problems and their process. The interesting section is other accounts.</p>

    <h3>Other accounts</h3>
    <p>This section has 3 subsections, the first is not highly of interest consisting of an account of the design of a hospital by a famous architect. Instead, the other two sections are very much of interest.</p>

    <h4>The use of analogy</h4>
    <p>Initial design ideas are appreciated from outside the immediate context of a specific question are often highly influential. Often this is in the form of a reference to an outside object <a class="citation" href="#">[1]</a> of the same type as the desired object. As an example, a web project might reference a web object. Other times the object referenced is further afield. Like a banana, as an inspiration for a chair.</p>

    <p>Sometimes these analogies serve a designer's purposes beyond the project. They become a central driving force in their work. Frank O. Gehry's use of paper folds and crumples to inspire shape is one example. The shapes of Bjarke Ingels's work might be another one.</p>

    <p>Rowe seems to imply on page 32, that these analogies are most active in times where there are looser constraints.</p>

    <h4>Big ideas and operational constraints</h4>
    <p>Rowe's case studies demonstrated that certain analogies will be tenaciously held on to by designers, often in the face of the huge obstacles <a class="citation" href="#">[2]</a>. With designers who develop these connections to their metaphors, this often involves an enormous amount of effort on the part of the designer.</p>

    <h4>The other important observations</h4>
    <p>Design process unfolds episodically <a class="citation" href="#">[3]</a>. Rowe characterizes this as a series of skirmishes, where various aspects of the design situation are challenged. This set of interactions tends to have the following characteristics <a class="citation" href="#">[4]</a> <a class="citation" href="#">[5]</a>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are "to and from" moments where different problems compete for time and resources. Where constraints and potential.</li>
        <li>There are periods of unfettered speculation, followed by more contemplative evaluation. This seems similar to Bradbury's throw up onto the page what is inside of you in the morning, edit in the afternoon.</li>
        <li>Each episode tends to have an orientation to a facet of the design problem/situation.</li>
        <li>Each episode has characteristics where the design becomes absorbed in a "dialog" between the designer and the situation. Often times these involved exercises where the designer had to press through with some amount of ambiguity.</li>
        <li>Pressing on tended to lead to more clarity, which resulted in designers backtracking to further strengthen <a class="citation" href="#">[6]</a> their design ideas.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Finally, as the design situation clarified, the episodic nature of designing decreased, as the work solidified into frameworks built around the design ideas <a class="citation" href="#">[7]</a>.</p>

    <p>These episodes give rise to questions about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The inherent structure of the episodes</li>
        <li>The kind of information used in each episode</li>
        <li>The relationships to the procedures being used</li>
        <li>How episodes relate to one another and how one leads into another</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These episodes "possess an interior logic (p. 35)" which may be partly dictated by the subject matter and systems in place in the design process.</p>

    <p>Closure seems like a prerequisite to Rowe, because he sees issues with having any outcome at all without closure.</p>

    <p>Within these episodic structures, the process develops from nebulous to specific to defined.</p>

    <p>Moments of blinding occur, where the designer overlooks an important factor. This leads to backtracking where the process becomes more nebulous. This seems to have be tied to how the designer represents the project at hand <a class="citation" href="#">[8]</a>.</p>

    <p>Designers bring organizational principles to design problems. Even when these principles prevent moving forward, designers will rarely re-examine them for fresh points of departure. Clear delineations can be made between the techne and ontology employed by designers and the constraints and opportunities of a project.</p>

    <p>The style of projects was determined by two factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sustained influence of initial design ideas in the form of organizing principles, rules, and references.</li>
        <li>The structure of the design process itself. In particular, the way that design principles were applied seems to have been a factor.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Finally, Rowe writes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "The kind of theory we need if we are to explain what is going on when we design must go beyond matters of procedure. We need to move directly into the realm of normative discourse about what constitutes architecture and urban design in order to clarify both the inherent nature of the enterprise and the direction in which procedures are inclined. Furthermore, we need to ask how this discourse is shaped and what frames of reference are appropriated by its shaping. Definitions of problem-solving procedures are not enough. We must also explore what we can say about the services in which these procedures are placed. (p. 37)"<a class="citation" href="#">[9]</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>General Thoughts & Back Matter</h3>
    <p>As they happened</p>

    <p>It's clear that Rowe has read Sch√∂n's work and been influenced by it <a class="citation" href="#">[10]</a>. It appears as though By Their Own Design, by Suckle

 (1980) needs some looking into.</p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>
    <!-- Footnotes go here -->
    <p class="footnote">[1] This is reference specifically as an architectural object in the book. Changed for clarity.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[2] There is an interesting parallel between this tenacity and the concept of design fixation. There is some divergence between the concepts. Mainly that the case studies are successful. Also, there is a pretty extensive body of literature on design fixation.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[3] The episodic nature of design indicates, to me, a complex cognitive process. It also to some extent justifies the IP approach. See Massaro and Cowan (1993) for an explanation of the IP approach to cognition.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[4] See pages 34-35.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[5] The book tag I used to mark this section indicated that this observation was something that I clearly thought would be important to attempt to capture in my own research. In particular in structuring my interviews.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[6] In Rowe's words, "retrenched to what seemed a more advantageous position. (p 35)"</p>
    <p class="footnote">[7] This is interesting in the context of my interview data.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[8] Is problem representation in my interview content? How?</p>
    <p class="footnote">[9] This seems to me to be Rowe, saying that the medium of design cannot be separated entirely from the process. I think there is some relevance in this, in that material and its place in culture will affect the production process as well as the object itself.</p>
    <p class="footnote">[10] See citations at the start of the section on page 34.</p>
